# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow for Code Kentucky
A bit about myself - I live in Kentucky and am signed up for Code Kentucky and working to complete prework so that I can start in August.  At this point I beleive I'm most interested in the Data Analysis with Python as I think that could be the most beneficial skillset to add with my current experience but this may change once we get started.  Outside of enjoying learning and looking forward to a new challenge and networking I keep busy in my life where I am married and have a 5 year old that I try to keep up with.
